# 4.2 - Docker Compose



\*\*\*\*[**Docker Compose vs Puppet Labs: What are the differences?**](https://stackshare.io/stackups/docker-compose-vs-puppet)\*\*\*\*

Developers describe **Docker Compose** as "_Define and run multi-container applications with Docker_". With Compose, you define a multi-container application in a single file, then spin your application up in a single command which does everything that needs to be done to get it running. On the other hand, **Puppet Labs** is detailed as "_Server automation framework and application_". Puppet is an automated administrative engine for your Linux, Unix, and Windows systems and performs administrative tasks \(such as adding users, installing packages, and updating server configurations\) based on a centralized specification.

Docker Compose and Puppet Labs are primarily classified as **"Container"** and **"Server Configuration and Automation"** tools respectively.

**"Multi-container descriptor"** is the top reason why over **111** developers like Docker Compose, while over **45** developers mention **"Devops"** as the leading cause for choosing Puppet Labs.

Docker Compose and Puppet Labs are both open source tools. Docker Compose with **16.4K** GitHub stars and **2.52K** forks on GitHub appears to be more popular than Puppet Labs with **5.34K** GitHub stars and **2.1K** GitHub forks.

According to the StackShare community, Docker Compose has a broader approval, being mentioned in **787** company stacks & **608** developers stacks; compared to Puppet Labs, which is listed in **181** company stacks and **48** developer stacks.
